My Strateghy to solve problem
      - Read the question thrice.
      - Think about diifrent approches
      - Consider different approaches.
      - If one works, continue solving ahead.
      - Otherwise, search for how to address specific issues (e.g., sorting, checking integers, reversing, etc.).
